# Business-School-Prediction-Model
Overview This project uses machine learning techniques to predict rankings for the Top 100 Business Schools based on various institutional metrics. By analyzing key indicators, such as faculty composition, student satisfaction, and alumni success, this project provides a data-driven approach to ranking prediction, offering insights into factors influencing business school performance.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Model Training: Implements models like Random Forest, XGBoost to predict rankings.

Model Evaluation: Assesses models using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE to select the best performing model.

Feature Importance: Identifies and interprets important features contributing to ranking prediction. Dataset

The dataset includes metrics for each business school, such as:

Faculty composition (e.g., percentage with PhDs)

Student satisfaction and alumni outcomes

Research output and international mobility

Usage

Load Data: Import the business school dataset into the notebook.

Run Analysis: Execute cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and analyze results.

Explore Results: Use feature importance and model evaluation to gain insights on ranking predictors.

Customize: Adjust model parameters or add new models to refine predictions.
